        As part of a work-study program in high school, I (unexpectedly) found myself sitting at a desk answering the phone in a call center for a certain delivery company. Unfortunately, it was a much greater struggle than I could have expected. Every time I picked up the phone, I was met with explosive anger, occassionally traded out with a desperate cry for help. However, the worst part wasn't the callers' attitudesâ€”no, it was the fact that their time with me was always miserable, but I couldn't do anything to help them.<br>
        <br>
        I empathized with the customers' hardships, so I didn't blame them for their distraught emotions. But in the end, empathy was all I could give; all I had to offer to my customers during their time of distress were many apologies and the occasional gift card. However, with each heartbreaking phone call I answered, I started to form a clearer image of what I wanted to do with my future. What I want is to give people an experience the complete opposite of this one, one where my presence and influence brings them both excitement and ease of mind. Whatever I did, I wanted to make sure that I accomplished this goal.<br>
        <br>
        With this motivation guiding my path, my proficiency in math led me to begin studying computer science in college, initially aiming to be a front-end developer, where my work could directly interact with users. However, as I gained more experience, I realized my true passion lied in the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) field instead. Rather than the actual implentation, I found I love generating ideas for how to create an intuitive design and trying to understand the user's perspective. Further, in this discipline I can make use of the technical knowledge from my computer science degree and my analytical mindset, as well as my more creative talents in areas like art, music, and writing. Equipped with these experiences, I hope to enter the UI/UX field to provide users what I couldn't over the phone: an uplifting, enjoyable experience.

        Ever since I was a child, music has always been a large part of my life. I started learning the piano at a young age and eventually picked up the violin as well. Though I eventually switched from violin to trumpet, I continue to play both the piano and trumpet to this day.<br>
        <br>
        Besides music, I also enjoy trying to improve my skills in art and writing. For example, my interest in writing led me to become involved with MAL Rewrite, a volunteer organization on <a target="_blank" href="https://myanimelist.net">MyAnimeList</a> that is dedicated to writing original, high quality synopses for all the entries on the site, which I now help lead as a coordinator.
