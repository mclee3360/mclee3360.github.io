        As part of a work-study program in high school, I (unexpectedly) found myself sitting at a desk answering the phone in a call center for a certain delivery company. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a much greater ordeal than I ever expected. Every time I picked up the phone, I was met with exploding rage, which was occassionally traded in for overflowing despair instead. However, the worst part wasn't the callers' attitudesâ€”no, it was the fact that I was helpless to make a difference in their experience.<br>
        <br>
        I didn't blame the customers for their distraught emotions, empathizing with their hardships. But in the end, that was all I could do; all I had to offer to my troubled customers during their time of distress was many apologies and the occasional gift card. With each heartbreaking phone call I answered, I started to form a clearer image of what I wanted to do with my future: provide people an experience the complete opposite of this one: an experience that would raise them up, rather than break them down.<br>
        <br>
        With a goal in sight, I decided to utilize my proficiency in math to begin studying computer science in college, initially aiming to be involved with front-end development, where my work could directly interact with users. However, as I gained more experience, I realized my true passion lied in the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) instead. Rather than the actual implentation, I found I love generating ideas for how to create an intuitive design and trying to understand the user's perspective. Further, this field combines together the technical knowledge I cultivated through my computer science degree, my analytical method of thinking, as well as my more creative pursuits in areas like art, music, and writing. With these experiences in hand, I hope to enter the UI/UX field to provide users what I couldn't over the phone: an uplifting, enjoyable experience.

        Ever since I was a child, music has always been a large part of my life. I started learning the piano at a young age and eventually picked up the violin as well. Though I eventually switched from violin to trumpet, I continue to play both the piano and trumpet to this day.<br>
        <br>
        Besides music, I also enjoy trying to improve my skills in art and writing. For example, my interest in writing led me to become involved with MAL Rewrite, a volunteer organization on <a target="_blank" href="https://myanimelist.net">MyAnimeList</a> that is dedicated to writing original, high quality synopses for all the entries on the site, which I now help lead as a coordinator.
