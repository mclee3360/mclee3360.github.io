 - title: 'Information Technology Intern'
   place: 'Chick-fil-A Support Center'
   date: 'May 2018 to August 2018'
   description: |
       As an intern at Chick-fil-A, I worked together with the Common Platforms team, whose main goal is to maintain and improve the systems and services that the other teams in the IT department rely on. The internship focused on three major areas: a single large project, being the development of Monita, which is explained below; multiple smaller side projects that helped me better understand the different types of work my team was involved in; and networking with people across the department. For the projects specifically, the main aim was in easing the workload for my team, whether through automating simple but time-consuming tasks or centralizing information about the applications that they manage.
   tasks: |
       <li>Developing Monita, a web application to display the status of a variety of different applications and servers.</li>
       <li>Developing Python scripts to automate the creation and modification of jobs for Unijob, an application that runs scripts on time-based triggers.</li>
       <li>Writing detailed documentation on how to use and update the projects I worked on.</li>
       <li>Delivering a presentation to the IT department about the projects I worked on and their benefits.</li>

 - title: 'Quality Assurance Automation Intern'
   place: 'Elavon, The Grove'
   date: 'May 2017 to August 2017'
   description: |
       As an intern at Elavon, I worked with the QA team on testing Converge Mobile, a mobile application used by businesses for processing transactions. I initially focused on refactoring the existing automation test suite in order for it to work more reliably and quickly. Afterwards, I focused on adding to the test suite in order to expand the test coverage of functionality and interactions throughout the application, as well as adding additional quality-of-life features such as parallel testing on multiple different devices at once, and listeners that would screenshot the application upon failure.
   tasks: |
       <li>Developing automated regression tests in Appium to check functionality and front-end interactions for Converge Mobile.</li>
       <li>Identifying existing bugs in Converge Mobile, and then submitted detailed reports to the developers in order to recreate and fix the issues.</li>
       <li>Gaining experience working in an Agile development environment.</li>
