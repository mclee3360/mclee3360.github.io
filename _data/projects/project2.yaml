    When refugees arrive in America at the end of their resettlement process, they often need a variety of different forms, such as medical records, to integrate into society and receive proper care. However, these can be difficult to keep up with during their displacement, and the documents might not be in a state that professionals can easily accept.<br>
    <br>
    To help tackle this problem, a group of Master's students at Emory Univerisy enlisted my capstone project team to develop an Android application that would aid refugees in managing their personal documents. These documents can be stored as PDFs—either by uploading from the phone's local storage or converting pictures taken with the camera—and shared through a temporary link. After finishing our work on the application, my team passed it off to our partners for them to continue and refine so that it will one day end up on the phones of refugees.

              Users log in and register in the app using an email and password, with user data—including account information, documents, and more—stored in Google Firebase. Within each account, multiple profiles can be made that each represent a single person. One use case would be a family that uses a single account, and each family member would have their own profile within the account. The profiles are mostly for organizational purposes, as each profile stores their own set of documents.

              Once a profile is selected, the user is taken to the document dashboard screen, where all the documents under the profile are displayed. Specific documents can be searched for using the search bar, and profile information can be viewed or edited through the profile icon in the top-right.<br>

              New documents can be added by pressing the plus button at the bottom-right corner. This expands to reveal two options: upload through the phone's local storage and take a picture. Once an option is selected, information about the created document can be edited, which includes tags that can be searched for in the dashboard. Further, additional pages can be added using either upload method, allowing users to mix and match pictures and local files. Individual pages can also be viewed and deleted by selecting them. Finally, after confirming the document information, the file is created and shows up in the dashboard, and it now exists in the cloud database as well.

              After a document is created, it can be viewed at any time by selecting it on the dashboard. While viewing, the user may choose to edit the document's information or delete it entirely, the latter of which requires the user to re-enter their password. Further, the user is able to create a temporary link to share the document through the sharing button, and they can copy that link directly to their phone's clipboard to easily share with others.
