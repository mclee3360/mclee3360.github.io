    In order to keep up with modern web development trends, gaining familiarity with the major Javascript frameworks is essential. For this, I enrolled in Tyler McGinnis's <a href="https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/" target="_blank">online React course</a> to teach myself the skills needed to be proficient with React. As the final part of this course, we were instructed to make a web application to partially browse posts on Hacker News. The design of the website is based on the example website provided <a href="https://competent-tesla-bf9dde.netlify.com/">here</a>, with a few additional features added in. The project was of course developed using React, and then was bundled using Webpack and hosted on Netlify.
details:
    - title: "Post Feed"
      subsections:
          - text: |
              The initial page presents a list of the current top posts on Hacker News, displaying the titles and some metadata for each, which includes the username of the poster, the time it was posted, and the number of comments the post has. The subtitle also includes a link to the poster's profile, as well as a link to view the post's comments.<br>
              <br>
              An alternative feed can be viewed using the navigation bar at the top, which instead displays a list of the newest posts on Hacker News. The navigation bar also includes a button to toggle the website between a light and dark theme.

    - title: "Posts and Comments"
      subsections:
          - text: |
              When viewing a post's comments, the title and the post's metadata are displayed at the top, and if the post was a text post rather than a link, the associated text is displayed right underneath. Below that is a list of the top-level comments (if any) of the post, each within its own box. Each box contains the comment's meta information and text, which includes a link to view the comment as its own post and see any sub-comments that it might have, an additional feature not in the original design.<br>
              <br>
              Each comment's page is structured the same as a post's page, with only a few changes. Given that it's not a post, no title is displayed. Further, a link to return back to its parent is provided in its place, whether to a post or another comment. Another feature not in the original design is the ability to load more than the initial set of comments after scrolling to the bottom. Normally, only the top 50 comments are loaded, but if so desired, the user may choose to load in the remaining comments without having to reload the entire page.

    - title: "User Profiles"
      subsections:
          - text: |
              In each user's profile, a list of posts that the user has submitted can be seen, similar to the feed of top or new posts. The page also contains some additional information about each user underneath their username, including the date that they joined Hacker News and how much "karma" they have, which is a measurement of the total number of times the user's posts were voted up.
