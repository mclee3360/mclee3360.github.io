    An interactive information visualization (InfoViz) created using D3 with the help of a partner as the final project for an InfoViz course. This visualization was created using a slightly modified dataset provided to us based on the data collected for a casual survey conducted by The University of British Columbia. The original dataset can be viewed <a href="http://www.scq.ubc.ca/so-much-candy-data-seriously/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>. The main purpose of this visualization is for users to determine what type of treat they should or shouldn't give out during Halloween by identifying which treats were most loved and most despised.

              A double-sided bar chart serves as the main visual, depicting the percentage of people that responded with "joy" or "despair" to receiving a specific treat on Halloween. On the right are several control options as well as an additional graph to view more information about a selected treat.

    - title: "Hover and Selection"
      subsections:
          - text: |
              Hovering over a bar causes the name of the treat to appear next to the cursor. This treat also appears on the bar chart to the right, showing the exact percentage for each type of response to the treat, including neutral ones, to one decimal place. A bar can be clicked to lock it into the right chart as "selected", allowing the user to easily compare with a different treat by hovering.

    - title: "Filter, Sort, and Group"
      subsections:
          - text: |
              Various filtering options exist, including by country, gender, and age. The former two can be toggled using checkboxes, while the latter can be filtered to a specific range using a double-sided slider. This data can also be sorted alphabetically by treat name, or by the percentage of joy or despair responses, both ascending and descending. Finally, treats can be grouped by type: candy, chocolate or other. Through this function, users are able to get a more higher level view of opinions towards certain categories of Halloween treats, as opposed to a single brand.
