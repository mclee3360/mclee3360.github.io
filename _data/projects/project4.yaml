    A personal project to create a website that would keep track of all the synopses I've worked on as a member of MAL Rewrite and showcase some of the highlights. MAL Rewrite is a volunteer writing organization for <a href="https://myanimelist.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MyAnimeList</a>, the largest online database for East Asian media, dedicated to writing original, high-quality synopses for all the entries on the site. It is a static website and hosted on GitHub pages.

              This page contains a datatable that allows the user to browse through all the works I have contributed to, with functionality to sort and filter by various parameters. Each row contains a link to the entry on MAL for the user to directly read if the synopsis has been uploaded.
