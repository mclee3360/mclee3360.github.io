            Back when I was still planning on being a developer, I had no intentions of creating a personal website. Generally, a resume and a link to my Github would have been enough to show my experience in programming and the types of projects I had been involved in. However, after I changed course and began pursuing work in the UI/UX field instead, I realized that simply handing recuriters my Github would not be sufficient.<br>
            <br>
            For UI/UX, I found that I would need to showcase the projects I've worked on in a more visible, tangible way. Moreover, a large part of UI/UX is all about the process, rather than the final product, so potential employers would want to see how I think and how I approached the problems I faced. In order to easily demonstrate these things to others, I knew that I would need some kind of portfolio that would showcase a selection of my projects and dive deep into the how's and why's of what I did.

        Develop a website that would detail my thoughts during the design process of the displayed projects, created from scratch to showcase my technical skills.

                  Before I even started brainstorming ideas for what I wanted my website to look like, first I needed to understand what kind of content it needed. I browsed through several articles and example portfolios in order to better understand the domain. In particular, the portfolios of <a href="http://christinarichardson.ca/" target="_blank">Christina Richardson</a> and <a href="http://john-ellison.com/" target="_blank">John Ellison</a> provided a lot of inspiration to both the contents of my website, as well as the layout and styling.<br>
                  <br>
                  From my research, I decided that the best approach for me would be to highlight four of my projects and take a deep dive into each of them, explaining the problem space as well as the design process throughout. The website would also include some personal information about myself so that the people who view the website could better understand my mindset and background. This would include standard resume information like my education history and my skills, but also more personal stories, such as why I entered the UI/UX space and my hobbies.<br>
                  <br>
                  Once I determined the contents of my website, I began sketching out ideas for how everything should be laid out. The site was divided into 6 major pages: the home page, about page, and four project pages. On the home page, overview information helps the viewer get a short glimpse at what else is on the site, both for my projects as well as about myself. Meanwhile, the about page and all the project pages go into more detail about their respective topics, divided into subsections to help organize everything that is written.

                  One of the things that I focused on was making navigation simple, while trying to avoid cluttering the interface. Especially because of the large amount of text in a site like this, being able to quickly navigate to wherever desired would be essential. One approach for this issue was the ever present menu bar at the top of the screen. This allows users to navigate to any of the six pages at any time, as well as to some major subsections like the "Contacts" section. On the other hand, overview sections often contain links to different pages or sections that elaborate on what is being overviewed, such as how the project overviews on the home screen contain links to their respective project pages. Between these two methods, most of the major subsections should be able to be reached quickly, especially when the user is already viewing related content.

                  Finally, one other aspect I tried to focus on was making the layout mobile-friendly so that I wouldn't have to worry too much about mobile responsiveness during development. Websites are viewed on a mobile device more now than ever, which makes it particularly important that websites look good on a smaller, more vertical screen as well. This involved design choices like constraining all content on the screen to a narrower column, as well as laying out objects so that they could collapse easily into a single column when viewed on a vertical screen.

                  After identifying what I wanted as the content and layout of my website through research and sketches, I began working on creating a wireframe. My goal for this wireframe was to make it look as close to the envisioned final product as possible. By doing so, I could avoid having to constantly make adjustments to the interface's design during development, and it would instead let me focus on the actual coding and writing. I created both a clean and an annotated version of each wireframe, the former to see exactly what the site page would look like, while the latter would have all my notes about the fine details written down to make it easily reproducible. I also used placeholders for almost all of the images on the website since I hadn't collected the ones I wanted to use at that time.<br>
                  <br>
                  Below are the wireframes for the home page.

          subsections:

                  When time for actual development came, not much changed in terms of the design, mainly because the wireframes already laid everything out exactly as planned. However, there were still several minor changes made, mostly from scenarios I didn't anticipate until development began. For instance, I avoided alternating the positions of images and text, as seen in the home page's project overview section, since it would then alternate between having the image at the top or bottom of the section when in mobile. I also added a contacts section at the bottom of every page, making it even easier to access this important information.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the project pages, I shrunk down the sizes of the images, as they would take up significant amounts of space on both desktop and mobile. I also added an overview section for the "Takeaways"/"Final Thoughts" subsection, since the solution subsections ended up being pretty long, making it very tedious to scroll past it to get to this section. Finally, I added a link in the project overview to the final version of the project when possible to be able to see the project in a working state, rather than just from screenshots.<br>
                  <br>
                  Besides the above, nothing else really changed in the design from the wireframes. The website was developed using the Jekyll framework, mainly for its templating features, but it also worked well with Github pages, which is where I chose to host the site to avoid hosting fees. This also separated the writing from the coding, which enables me to swap out projects much easier. I also created most of the art assets on the site from scratch so as to avoid any odd trademark or copyright violations, with the exceptions being the LinkedIn logo and the about page's header, which I found <a href="https://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=447202" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>

    overview: |
        Doing research to understand the domain space and to view what others have done is very useful. A detailed wireframe also significantly speeds up the development process.
    text: |
        Despite the lack of user testing, I was pleased with how the design of my website turned out. Doing background research before I began sketching out potential designs was critical in this process. This helped me understand what exactly I needed to include, and it also provided inspiration as to what works and what doesn't from the designs that other people have created. Trying to think up designs without clearly understanding the problem space is signficantly more diffcult than when I know what my constraints are.<br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, taking the time to create a detailed wireframe had a signficant impact on development. The actual coding fell into place very quickly since I already knew exactly how I wanted everything laid out. This also let me focus on the section that would take the longest and ultimately was the most critical: the writing. Though it took some time to create the wireframes, I believe the time saved during development, along with the quality of the final design, made it well worth it.
