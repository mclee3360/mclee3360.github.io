As part of a work-study program in high school, I (unexpectedly) found myself sitting at a desk answering the phone in a call center for a certain delivery company. Unfortunately, it turned out to be a much greater ordeal than I ever expected. Every time I picked up the phone, I was met with exploding rage, which was occassionally traded in for a wave of despair instead. However, the worst part wasn't the callers' attitudes&#8212;no, it was the fact that I was helpless to make a difference in their experience.<br>
<br>
I didn't blame the customers at all for the feelings they were experiencing; in fact, I completely empathized with their hardships. Canceled deliveries that wasted days off and dishonest drivers that claimed to have already stopped by were just a few of the many hardships that the customers faced, and that I had an opportunity to listen to. But in the end, that was all I <i>could</i> do; all I had to offer to my troubled customers during their time of distress were many apologies and the occasional gift card. With each phone call I answered, I started to form a clearer image of what I wanted to do with my future: provide the people who come in contact with my work an experience opposite of this one, <span class="emphasize">an experience that would raise them up, rather than tear them down.</span><br>
<br>
And so, the difficult times working at the call center developed a clear purpose that would drive me forward. I began studying computer science in college, initially hoping to be involved with front-end development, where my work could directly interact with users, but as I gained more experience, I realized my true passion lied in design instead. Rather than the actual implentation, I found I love generating ideas for how to create an intuitive design, or analyzing different designs to consider how they could be improved. Further, designing user interfaces and user experiences combines the technical knowledge I cultivated through my computer science degree, my analytical method of thinking, and my creative pursuits in areas like art, music, and writing. With my experiences and passions leading the way, I have set down the path of UI/UX design to give users what I couldn't over the phone: an uplifting, enjoyable experience.
